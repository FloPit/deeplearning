    "All the layers use tanh as the activation functions, and Xavier normal initializer is employed for the weight initializations [38]. Back-propagation learning is used for the updates of the weights in the network. The Adam optimization algorithm [40] is used with mini-batches for the updates. For each training epoch, the samples are randomly divided into multiple mini-batches with each batch containing 512 samples, and put into the training system. Next, the network information, i.e. the weights in each layer, are optimized based on the mean loss function of each mini-batch. It should be noted that the selection of batch size affects the network training performance [45]. The batch size of 512 samples is found appropriate based on the experiments and it is used in all the case studies in this paper. In addition, varying learning rate is adopted. For the first 200 epochs from the beginning, the learning rate is 0.001 for fast optimization. The learning rate of 0.0001 is used afterwards for stable convergence. The maximum number of the training epochs is 250."
